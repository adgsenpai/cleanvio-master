### ⛔️ DEPRECATED was one of my early programming noob projects

C# + Python tool - Movie Player to filter profanity from video files 

Unfortunately, this repo is deprecated and no longer works. 

But I will share the methodology, on the technologies this app was made with.

For `video rendering in C#`
- this video might help

- for removing profanity 
  `cleanvid` will help 
   https://github.com/mmguero/cleanvid
  it is a python script powered by `ffmpeg` that uses an input of (movie subtitles file, movie file) to mute profanity from video files

If there are any other questions feel free to shout out on my email or WhatsApp or chat here! Really apologize for not maintaining this repo was a noob GitHub user then 2 years back.
